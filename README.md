## 🐴 Professional Uma Musume Trainer
I know my Gold Ship from my Narita Taishin. Gacha luck? Questionable. Dedication? Unmatched.

## 🧠 Limbus Company Strategist
I navigate the madness with Don Quixote and Faust like it’s a 9-to-5. EGO builds, team synergies, and lore deep dives—I'm in too deep and loving it.

## 💻 Coding Random Bullshit™
Sometimes it's Python. Sometimes it's C#. WINDWOS Shall die but I'm scared of Linux.  
If it compiles, it's production-ready. If it doesn't, it's probably still in production.
